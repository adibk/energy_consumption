# CO2 Emissions and Energy Consumption Analysis for Seattle Buildings

This project involves analyzing CO2 emissions and energy consumption data for 3376 buildings in Seattle. The aim is to provide insights into factors impacting emissions and to develop a predictive model to estimate future emissions and energy consumption. The results are presented through an interactive dashboard.

## Project Overview
The project is divided into several key steps:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Process and clean the dataset to ensure it is suitable for analysis and modeling.

2. **Model Research**: Investigate suitable models for predicting CO2 emissions and energy consumption.

3. **Baseline Model Creation**: Develop an initial baseline model to provide a reference point for further improvements.

4. **Model Iteration and Optimization**: Iterate on the baseline model, optimizing parameters to improve accuracy.

5. **Model Explainability**: Apply methods such as SHAP to interpret and explain the model's predictions.

6. **Dashboard Creation**: Develop an interactive dashboard using Streamlit or Power BI to visualize the analysis and model results.

## Data
The dataset consists of information on 3376 buildings with 46 columns, representing annual measurements collected in 2016 by city agents.
